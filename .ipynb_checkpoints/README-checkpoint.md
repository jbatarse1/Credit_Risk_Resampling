# Credit_Risk_Resampling

This Python application is to validate the performance of a predictive logistic regression model. This program runs in Jupyter Lab.

It uses dataset manipulation and resampling methods to perform analysis; and uses a correlation to validate if any predictable relationship exists between Loan Status trends and the exposure to high risk loan defaults.

Also, reporting techniques for both models are created to predict loan status and creditworthiness of borrowers.

Finally, a report called the Overview of the Analysis is provided.
